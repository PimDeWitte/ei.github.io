        <h1>October 22, 2024 | Embedded Intelligence Inc</h1>

        <p><em>We've raised a $10M seed from General Catalyst, Valor, SV Angel, Conviction Embed, and Medal.</em></p>

        <p>We're at a crossroads in how humanity interacts with AI. We either continue towards a path that puts AI increasingly in charge, or we carve a path where humans stay in the driver's seat. Whether we stay in control depends on how fast we embed intelligence into our existing workflows. Over the next 10 years, each of us starts to exist below the model's API as they delegate to us, or rise above them by adapting.</p>

        <h2>The Browser is Slowing us Down</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Browsers force you to show up to websites and explain what you're doing, and what you want apps to do for you. Because they cannot see what you're doing as you go through different apps.</li>
            <li>Browsers have no continuous access to files on your computer, can't start your favorite apps when you start your computer, or respond to actions like copying images or capturing audio.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As a result, browser based apps like ChatGPT and Claude feel impersonal. It cannot see or hear what you're doing throughout the day. It can't help you in your existing workflows - instead it forces you into theirs. The companies behind the browsers aren't going to fix this - they are using the browser to push people into their own AI apps. You're already seeing this today with Gemini and Chrome. And while browsers are not the right fit for tomorrow's world- it is empirical that what comes next is built on the web stack - enabling devs to build on open, cross-platform standards, and a mature ecosystem of tooling.</p>

        <h2>Capture Is The Interface that Unlocks the next 1B Users</h2>

        <p>The extent to which LLMs are useful to people depends on how well they understand the limitations. But what if we didn't need to write prompts or understand LLMs at all? What if capture can help interfaces understand us, adapt to us, and teach us what they are capable of <em>inside</em> our workflows. It would unlock a generation of users like our parents, and be increasingly useful alongside autonomy, as a control system.</p>

        <h2>Capture-based Prompts Replace Websites & Apps</h2>

        <p>With native context, many <a href="https://x.com/PimDeWitte/status/1833166174630052319">prompts become as powerful as apps</a>. You no longer need interfaces to <a href="https://chat.highlight.ing/prompts/ultimate-meeting-summarizer-OzAZY7NRa5hi">summarize a call</a> or <a href="https://chat.highlight.ing/prompts/code-logic-explainer-DFEUsJ3J20z8">explain code</a>. But you're glad to have one to <a href="https://highlightai.com/apps/meme0">create memes</a> or <a href="https://highlightai.com/apps/conversations">collect meeting notes</a></p>

        <p><a href="https://highlightai.com/">HighlightAI</a> is a secure, intermediary capture layer built on OS outputs, paired with a context runtime, and <a href="https://highlightai.com/apps">App Store</a> allowing you to run <strong>prompts and web apps</strong> as native, context-aware assistants in minutes. Your collection of prompts and apps start to feel like <strong>your AI</strong> - one that deeply understands your world. It's built by the team that built the <a href="https://medal.tv/">largest capture app in the world</a>, and available on Windows & Mac.</p>
